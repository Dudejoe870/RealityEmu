# Reality Emulator

## About

This is an emulator for the Nintendo 64, released in 1996 (1997 in North America), the Nintendo 64 is home to some of the greatest games of all time in gaming's history, including games like "Super Mario 64", "The Legend Of Zelda: Ocarina Of Time", "The Legend Of Zelda: Majora's Mask", as well as many others.  

This emulator actually isn't the first N64 emulator that [I](https://github.com/Dudejoe870) have created.  I also had worked on another emulator, [Ryu64](https://github.com/Ryu64Emulator/Ryu64) programmed in C#.  After many months of working on it, I had realized that C# just isn't the way to go for emulators, along with the fact that I had made some fundamental mistakes in my original CPU core that would've taken a long time to fix.  I decided that I would start a new emulator written in C instead.

## Progress

This emulator is in the early stages so no games are playable, in the future some may boot, but currently none do.

# FAQ

## Why make another Nintendo 64 emulator?
Why not?  I have a passion for emulation, and a good way to feed that passion is to make an emulator.  The choice in the Nintendo 64 is purely just because I think the console is very interesting.

## Is **X** Game Playable?
No.  At this point no games are playable.  Even if they did boot this emulator doesn't even have controller support, so good luck navigating the main menu.

## How do I make **X** Game work?
Refer to the answer above.

## I know how to program in C, can I help?
Yes, just submit a PR.  Any help you can give is appreciated.

## I know how to program in "**X** Language that is not C", can I help?
No, this emulator is programmed in C, the chances of you being able to help are slim to none.  However, if you still know the Nintendo 64 well, then perhaps you can help in other ways.

## How can I use your code?
Check the "UNLICENSE" file for details.  However in short, you can do pretty much whatever you want with it.

Okay well, hopefully that answered your questions, we currently do not have a Discord at this time, however that will come sooner rather than later, I am just waiting for this project to become a little more sophisticated.
